- IPv4 Option printing (same)
- Remove unused code
- Fix the goddamn bytes count for errors

- FIX UNALIGNED READ WITH -fsanitize=undefined


FAIT
- Using time included in the packet instead of iter->sent_instant
- Stop checking sequence of receiving
- More read before sending (based on time since last send)
- Detect duplicates (If I have the force to do)
